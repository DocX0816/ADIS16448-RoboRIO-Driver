UPDATE VERSIONS IN BOTH JAVA AND C++ BUILD.GRADLE FILES AND IN THE JSON FILE BEFORE BUILDING AND PUBLISHING!!!

Build before publishing or zip files will not be found.
.\gradlew build
      or
.\gradlew component:build
      where component is java or c++

Then publish
.\gradlew publish
     or
.\gradlew component:publish

The artifacts to be published to maven are in the maven directory (of the root project)
The contents of maven need to be copied to ~/frc2019/maven (or C:\Users\Public\frc2019\maven)
The ADIS16448.json (in vendordeps) file needs to be copied to ~/frc2019/vendordeps (or C:\Users\Public\frc2019\vendordeps)

The library can then be added to a project with visual studio code's manage vendor libraries feature. 

Copy the contents of the build/maven-release to maven.juanjchong.com/release directory
Copy the json to maven.juanjchong.com/
